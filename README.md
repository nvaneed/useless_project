AUTOMATIC ATTENDENCE SYSTEMüéØ
The automatic attendence system made by esp32 + rfid + google sheet + face verification (two factor auth)
Team Name: Navaneeth's Team
Team Members
Team Lead: [NAVANEETH P] - [College of Engineering and Management Punnappra]

Project Description
[Connected RFID with Google Sheets so attendance goes directly online‚Ä¶ no paper, no pen, just beep and done ]

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Some students are too smart‚Ä¶ they swipe multiple cards together and mark attendance for half the class ]

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[I fixed it by adding a face verification step using AI camera + Python‚Ä¶ now even if you have 10 cards, your face has to match ]

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

[Python, JS, C]

[OpenCV, numpy, json]

For Hardware:

[ESP32, RFID reader, amplifier module, relay]

Project Documentation
[First the ESP32 reads the unique card ID, then sends an HTTP request to Google Sheets link‚Ä¶ after that the AI camera checks face before confirming attendance]

### Project Documentation
[first read the unique id from different cards,then make a http request code in esp 32 to google sheet link ]
